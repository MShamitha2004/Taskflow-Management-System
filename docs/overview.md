TaskFlow — Overview

Problem
Most tools track task status but provide little visibility into how work actually happens. Teams lack insights into bottlenecks, focus time, and context switching.

Objective
Build a web app that combines Kanban task management with behavioral analytics and actionable suggestions.

Scope (MVP)
- Auth & Roles: Scrum Master, Employee
- Projects & Memberships, invites
- Kanban board (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done)
- Tasks (title, description, due date, assignee, comments, @mentions, attachments)
- Activity history
- Views: Kanban, List, Calendar, Dashboard
- Basic analytics and notifications

Success Criteria
- Working prototype by 18 Sep with demo script
- Analytics dashboard with at least 3 charts
- Daily/weekly summary generation (basic)
